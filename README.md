# LeaguePyBot

An attempt at a computer vision bot for League Of Legends (vs AI).

Only works on Windows.

Patterns in the client match the Japanese language of the interface.

Python

OpenCV for Computer Vision (Template Matching)

mss for fast screenshots

win32api for native clicks

pydirectinput for keyboard input (until I figure out win32keybd events)

Using threading pool to make the template matching faster.

But actually looking for better ideas to make the object detection realtime.
